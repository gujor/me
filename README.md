**Hi** 👋

This repository is about **me** 👨‍🔧

I don't like writing **resumes** ❌

But I like to **code** 💻

So I started **structure things** I have done using code ✅

…

Now I have more fun and can **generate** stuff like:

- A [resume](resume.md) browsable inside GitHub.
- A PDF version of the resume that you can download.
- Mock content usable when trying things out.
